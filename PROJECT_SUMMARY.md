## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Setup Environment**:
   ```bash
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   cp .env.example .env
   # Configure .env with BigQuery credentials
   ```

2. **Test Installation**:
   ```bash
   python test_server.py
   ```

3. **Run Server**:
   ```bash
   fastmcp run healthcare_mcp_server.py
   ```

## 🔧 Customization & Extension

The server is designed for easy extension with additional healthcare analytics:

### Adding New Tools
```python
@mcp.tool()
def get_medication_adherence(
    therapeutic_class: str,
    year: str = "2022"
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Common Extensions
- Medication adherence tracking
